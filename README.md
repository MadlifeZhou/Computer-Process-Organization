## Lab1 

Variant:  **3**

### Variant Description

Our task is to use Python to implement two binary trees-immutable type and mutable type. Among them, Zhou is responsible for developing mutable tree classes and mutable tree class test classes, and Wang is responsible for developing immutable tree and immutable tree development classes. Both of these trees must have the following functions: adding nodes, deleting nodes, calculating the number of nodes, conversion from and to python lists, finite element by speci ﬁ c predicate, map structure by speci ﬁ c function, structure by speci ﬁ c function, iterator

### mutable Tree

mutable Tree is develped by **Zhou Guancheng**

The functions of mutable tree are as follows：

- addNode

  

- size

  

- Remove a leaf of a tree

  

- to list

  

- from list

  

- map

  

- Filter

- filter

  

- reduce

  

- Find the elements level by level

  

- Iterator
